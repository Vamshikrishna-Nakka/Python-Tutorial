    "#### Multitasking\n",
    "- Multitasking, in general, is the capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. In technical terms, multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to perform different tasks at the same time. For instance, you are downloading something on your PC as well as listening to songs and concurrently playing a game, etc. All these tasks are performed by the same OS an in sync. This is nothing but multitasking which not just helps you save time but also increases productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two types of multitasking in an OS:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Process-based\n",
    " - Thread-based\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this we will be learning about Thread-based multitasking or Multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread\n",
    "- A thread is basically an independent flow of execution. A single process can consist of multiple threads. Each thread in a program performs a particular task.\n",
    "- Example, when you are playing a game say Pubg on your PC, the game as a whole is a single process, but it consists of several threads responsible for playing the music, taking input from the user, running the opponent synchronously, etc. All these are separate threads responsible for carrying out these different tasks in the same program.\n",
    "- Every process has one thread that is always running if we are not created also. This is the <b>main thread</b>. This main thread actually creates the child thread objects. The child thread is also initiated by the main thread. I will show you all further in this article how to check the current running thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### When to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multithreading is very useful for saving time and improving performance, but it cannot be applied everywhere.In the previous Pubg example, the music thread is independent of the thread that takes your input and the thread that takes your input is independent of the thread that runs your opponent. These threads run independently because they are not inter-dependent.Therefore, multithreading can be used only when the dependency between individual threads does not exist.\n",
    "- To achieve Multithreading we need to install with following command in the prompt <b>conda install -c conda-forge tbb</b> then we need to import the threading module."
