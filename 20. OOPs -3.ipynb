    "- 2) Lets take Animal as a Class that has a method sound(). but the forms of sound are different to different animals like: Roar, Meow, Oink etc."

For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading."
