    "- The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n",
    "- The keyword self represents the instance of a class and binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "- When we are creating an object it automatically  calls init(as default contructor in java) when it passed with values then that time also call init with parameters (as parameterized constructor in java) below we can see."
